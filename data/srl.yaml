    The Shared Reality Lab leverages our engineering skills and human-centered design experience to tackle a variety of problems of importance to society. We work with audio, video, and haptic technologies, mixed reality, machine learning, and mobile computing, building systems that facilitate and enrich both human-computer and computer-mediated human-human interaction. Active projects include [audio and audio-haptic rendering of graphics for blind users](https://image.a11y.mcgill.ca), development of conversational avatars for healthcare applications, [design of the flight deck of the future](projects/adair), and multimodal delivery of information to users in high-consequence environments. 

    For questions about the lab, please [contact Prof. Jeremy Cooperstock](https://cim.mcgill.ca/~jer/email.html).
