    title: Investigating visual and haptic guidance in the flight deck for future taxi operations
    caption: To accommodate more and more aircraft, airports are exploring time-constrained taxi operations. In these scenarios, flight crews must adhere to predefined speed profiles along their taxi routes, adding complexity to an already demanding phase of flight. Our research investigates how different guidance methods—ranging from visual cues to haptic feedback—affect pilot performance, workload, situational awareness, and attention allocation.

    title: Investigating Sonification for Accessible Interpretation of Complex Charts
    caption: "Inspired by the challenges that blind and low-vision individuals face with traditional financial visualizations, this study explores potential of sonification to render complex time-series data through sound. Within context of stock trading, we map three parameters: price, Relative Strength Index (RSI), and Bollinger Bands; into distinct auditory channels. By encoding both individual values and their dynamic interactions, our system aims to enable users to detect overbought/oversold conditions, volatility shifts, and trend reversals through only auditory cues."
